# Discount Radar
Are you sick and tired of missing out on discounts on items you are looking at on Amazon? Well look no further! With Discount Radar, you will be able to track those items you have been keeping your eye on!

## Overview

Discount Radar is an application designed to help users stay updated on the best discounts available on Amazon products. The app provides real-time tracking of price drops, deals, and offers across different product categories, making it easy for users to find the best bargains.

## Features

- **Track Price Drops**: Get notified when the price of a tracked product drops.
- **Search For Deals**: Easily search Amazon for discounted products in various categories
- **Discount Alerts**: Receive alerts when an item reaches a specific price threshold or goes on sale.
- **Product Details**: View product details using price history, images, and reviews

## How It Works

We are hoping to utilize the Amazon Product Advertising API to retrieve product information and track price changes. If a discount or price drop occurs, users are notified via a push notifications or app alerts.
